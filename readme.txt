For plugin authors. Showcase your plugins on your WordPress site. You only update your readme.txt files!

== Description ==

This plugin is for WordPress plugin __authors__, not __users__. It showcases your plugins on your WordPress blog, using the WordPress.org plugin repository as a source. It generates both a directory listing page, and the content of each plugin's page. All you have to provide is the title; the rest comes form the repository. You get to control the markup of each type of page using intuitive WordPress shortcodes.

== Installation ==

1. You're a plugin author. I really hope you know how to install plugins.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get more control of the FAQ and Changelog sections? =

For now, you have to use the markup the plugin provides. A future version will create loop-style tags, allowing you to customize the markup to your satisfaction.

= I've updated my plugin's `readme.txt` file. Why aren't the changes showing? =

Be patient. The API responses are cached for a little while.
